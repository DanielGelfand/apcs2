Algorithm - "Smells like recursion"

1) Choose a random square for the knight.

2) Move to a possible location.

3) Repeat until there are no more possible moves.

  3a) If all possible squares are visited then print the solution.

  3b) Else, backtrack and try alternative squares.

4) If after trying alternatives not all squares are visited, there is no solution.
